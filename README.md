# GCD-2015
In addition to this README, two files have been committed to this repo.
The first one is the R script called run_analysis.R. This is the code that can be run to transform the input data to the independent tidy data set, as long as the input data is put in appropriate directory. 
The second file is the CodeBook.md. This file explains the input data, resulting data sets during the process of the data transformation. It also describes the variables used in the final tidy data set.
